# API Testing
## Automate API testing
you can automate API testing using Python along with the `requests` library, which is a popular choice for making HTTP requests. Here's a basic example of how to automate API testing with Python:

- Install the `requests` library if you haven't already. You can install it using `pip`:

```bash 
pip install requests
```

- Write a Python script that uses the `requests` library to interact with your API endpoints. 

Here's an example script that sends `GET` and `POST` requests:
``` python
import requests

# Define the API endpoint URL
api_url = "https://api.example.com/users"

# Test Scenario 1: GET Request
response = requests.get(api_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Test Scenario 1: GET Request - Passed")
else:
    print("Test Scenario 1: GET Request - Failed")

# Test Scenario 2: POST Request
headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
data = {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}

response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=data)

if response.status_code == 201:
    print("Test Scenario 2: POST Request - Passed")
else:
    print("Test Scenario 2: POST Request - Failed")
```
You can further enhance this script by adding more test cases, handling response data, and incorporating assertions to validate the response content.

- Run the Python script:
```bash
python api_test.py
```

## Vue js & API testing 
If you're developing a Vue.js application that communicates with a REST API powered by FlightPHP and SQLite, you can choose from various tools and frameworks to test your API effectively. Here are some options to consider:

    Postman:
        Postman is a versatile tool that can be used for testing REST APIs regardless of your frontend technology. You can create collections of API requests, organize them, and run tests against your FlightPHP API. It's particularly useful for manual testing and exploration.

    Vue Test Utils with Jest:
        Since your frontend is Vue.js, you can use Vue Test Utils in combination with Jest for testing the Vue components that interact with your REST API. This is useful for testing the integration between your frontend and backend.

    Jest: Jest

    Cypress:
        Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework that allows you to write tests for both the frontend and the backend. You can use it to simulate user interactions with your Vue.js app and test the behavior of your FlightPHP API simultaneously.

    Supertest (Node.js):
        If you want to write API tests in Node.js that interact directly with your FlightPHP API, Supertest is a library that can help. You can use it in combination with a testing framework like Mocha or Jest to write and automate API tests.

    Dredd:
        Dredd is a testing tool for API documentation. If you have API documentation in place (e.g., OpenAPI or API Blueprint), Dredd can automatically validate your FlightPHP API endpoints against the documented behavior.

Choose the tool or combination of tools that best suits your testing needs and workflow. Consider factors like the complexity of your Vue.js application, the need for end-to-end testing, and whether you have API documentation that can be leveraged for testing.
