# MDX Files

MDX (Markdown + JSX) is an extension of Markdown that allows you to embed JSX (JavaScript XML) components within Markdown content.
MDX files blend the simplicity of Markdown with the flexibility of React components.
Ideal for creating dynamic content, interactive documentation, and integrating components into documentation or blog posts.
Supports not only basic Markdown features but also React components, making it suitable for building interactive web applications.

Example of MDX syntax:

```markdown

# Welcome to My Blog

This is some *Markdown* text.

<Button onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>Click Me</Button>
```
