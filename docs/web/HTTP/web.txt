A URN is analogous to a person's name, while a URL is analogous to their street address. In other words, a URN identifies an item and a URL provides a method for finding it. 
a URL is simply a URI that happens to point to a resource over a network.

	Example of resources: CSS stylesheets, images, scripts, and other resource
	=>  CORS allows web developers to control how their site reacts to cross-site requests.

		Example server response header:
		Accept-CH: Width, DPR, Viewport-Width
			the server is requesting information about 
			the client's width, device pixel ratio (DPR), and viewport width.
		the client Response:
